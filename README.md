# An alternative implementation of EIP7503 that is account based and has re-usable burn address
This repo is a PoC of a better way of doing plausible deniability on ethereum.   
However this repo is built as a ERC-20 compatible token but it can and should also be built into the base-layer of ethereum!
You can clone the repo and try-out the ui or try it on sepolia here: https://eip7503-erc20.jimjim.dev/

## The original EIP7503 
* Base layer of ethereum
* No re-usable addresses: `nullifier=hash(0x01,secret)` and the `address=hash(secret)` which means you cannot re-use that address
* No Hardware wallet support: because `address=hash(secret)` and the secret is a private input for the circuit, the hardware wallet would need to make the zk-proof on device which is not possible on the ledger, trezor, etc
* Uses the state-trie for inclusion proof (a hexanary tree with keccak), this is slow to proof and requires ton of ram.


## This repo 
* Is on the application layer (a contract) *(but can/should be implemented on base layer as well!!)*
* Uses a in-contract binary merkle tree with the poseidon2 hash function. 
* Re usable address: The balance tracking is split into 2, the total received and total spend.  
The total received is just the burned balance.  
The total spend is tracked inside a note based commitment scheme.   
* Hardware wallet support: `address=poseidon2Hash(public_key,shared_secret,"ZKWORMHOLE")` the circuit verifies a secp256k1 signature that authorize that pub_key to spend the funds. Here the hardware wallet can create the signature and then the users machine can create the proof.    


## nullifier and balance tracking
Instead of nullifying the entire address the circuit checks: `assert(burned_balance - total_spend >= amount_spend_in_tx)`.  
The `total_spend` is tracked in an account based note system where:   
`note_hash=poseidon2Hash(total_spent, account_nonce, viewing_key)` and   
`nullifier=poseidon2Hash(account_nonce, viewing_key)`    
The circuit does an inclusion proof of `prev_note_hash`, nullifies it and then creates a new note hash with the new total amount spend that is:   
`new_note_hash=poseidon2Hash(prev_total_spent+amount_spend_in_tx, account_nonce+1, viewing_key)`.    
On the first spend the inclusion proof of `prev_note_hash` is skipped (since it doesn't exist), but there is a nullifier is emitted, ensuring this can only happen once.  
  
The `burned_balance` is tracked by the contract in the merkle tree with a leaf that is `leaf=poseidon2Hash(recipient_address, balance)` and the circuit uses that to make inclusion proof.  
*note some code is different then the source for simplicity like the domain separators being omitted here ex:TOTAL_RECEIVED_DOMAIN*

## burn address and the 10$ billion collision attack (eip-3607)
The address scheme is `address=poseidon2Hash(public_key,shared_secret,"ZKWORMHOLE")`   
`"ZKWORMHOLE"`: is a string add as an extra measure to make sure zkwormhole addresses never collide with ethereum address even if they switched to poseidon2. `public_key` here is the x coordinate of the secp256k1 public key.  
`shared_secret`: a number that results in a valid PoW hash that makes finding a collision with EOA addresses much harder.
The PoW is verified like this:   
```rs
let address_hash: Field = Poseidon2::hash([pub_key,shared_secret, PRIVATE_ADDRESS_TYPE], 3);
let pow_hash: Field = Poseidon2::hash([shared_secret, address_hash], 2); 
assert_lt(pow_hash, POW_DIFFICULTY); 
```  

`address_hash` then has the first 12 bytes set to 0, so it the same length as ethereum address *(this is also the cause of that collision attack vector 😬).*

## optimizations
Merkle tree: The balances tracked in the merkle tree update on **every** transfer, even if a user never intends to use any privacy. This is to preserve plausible deniability. However this can optimized by:
* Only updating the recipient in the transfer, since burn addresses will never be senders! *(note that this does make the balance inaccurate for non burn addresses)*
* skipping merkle tree updates when `tx.origin==recipient`, since then the recipient is for sure a EOA and not a burn address.  
* WARNING: you might be tempted to check if recipient is a contract with `recipient.code!=0x00`, but this incentives EOAs to set code or user to use smart contract wallet to save on gas. **This breaks plausible deniability**.

## relayer
The relayer logic does accounting based on the baseFee which makes it more fair then the relayer in ex: tornadocash.   
Currently the ui has no relayer and just stores the proofs in localstorage to be self relayed from a different account.  
But the contract and circuit does support external relays and it is tested in `test/Token.test.ts`

## WARNINGS
* The value `POW_DIFFICULTY` has been set to an arbitrary number and **IS LIKELY INSECURE**

* Compliance (not legal advice ofc): the viewing_key can be used to reveal transaction history but that use case needs more research. It should also be possible to make a PoI scheme work without modifying the circuits/contracts like on railgun. As of now this repo doesn't provide tools for compliance.  
* This is unaudited and experimental. The poseidon2 contract is also experimental and built with huff: https://github.com/zemse/poseidon2-evm
